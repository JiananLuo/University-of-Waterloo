My better_evaluate function is based on focused_evaluate. They are very similar, but instead, my better_evaluate function has more evaluation condition than focused_evaluate. The better_evaluate checks current_player can win directly which has longest chain as 4. If so, the score will be (3001 - board.num_tokens_on_board()). If other_player can win directly which has longest chain as 4, the score will be (-3001 + board.num_tokens_on_board()). Other than this check for directly win, it also checks if the player can win indirectly. If the current_player can achieve a state where horizontally make a chain of 3, and both side is not occupied and also can be fill with any token. Then it is guarantee that by placing next token on either side of the chain, the current_player can win the game, since other_player can't stop the player from winning by stop the chain. Same thing for other_player, it will check if other_player can achieve the state for other_player can win indirectly.
