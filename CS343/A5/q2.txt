There is a livelock exist among the Angels. In the end of the video, we can see the way Doctor-Who tricked those angels is that, he left those angel to look each others eyes to make them form a quantum-locked. The mechanism of angels is: when they think someone is watching them, they will turn to stable state and will not move which can be define as quantum-locking; when they think no one is watching them, they will turn to unstable state which can be define as unlock. They got stucked in the live-lock by their own behavior that prevent them to unlock themselves. All the angles got looked at by another angle, so they quantum-locked each others. Since they got others watch them, so non of them could unlock themselves first. It makes them couldn't change their sight, therefore, they will be stuck in this stable state forever.
